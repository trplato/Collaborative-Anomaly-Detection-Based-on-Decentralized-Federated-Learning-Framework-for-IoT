# Collaborative-Anomaly-Detection-Based-on-Decentralized-Federated-Learning-Framework-for-IoT
Master Thesis Project in Shanghai Jiao Tong University

Motivated by the earlier publication "Collaborative Anomaly Detection for Internet of Things based on Federated Learning" in the international conference '2020 ICCC/CIC.'

The necessity of designing more suitable Anomaly Detection System network for IoT network has been raised.

Therefore, designing "Decentralized Federated Learning" has been targeted in this study for master's degree.
